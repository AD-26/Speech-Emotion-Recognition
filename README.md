# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
# 🎙️ Speech Emotion Recognition Web App

A machine learning-based web application for predicting emotions from speech using three different models: Random Forest, SVM, and LSTM. This project allows users to upload `.wav` files or use their microphone to perform real-time emotion detection. It also includes visualizations such as confusion matrices for model evaluation.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload `.wav` files for emotion prediction
- Real-time emotion detection via microphone
- Model comparison: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Confusion matrix visualization for each model
- Streamlit-based interactive web interface

## 🧠 Models Used

- 🎲 **Random Forest**: Traditional ensemble-based classifier.
- 🔍 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Effective for small to medium-sized datasets.
- 🔁 **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Deep learning model suitable for sequential audio features.

## 📁 Datasets Used

- **RAVDESS** (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)
- **TESS** (Toronto Emotional Speech Set)
- **EMO-DB** (Berlin Database of Emotional Speech)

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-emotion-recognition.git
   cd speech-emotion-recognition
